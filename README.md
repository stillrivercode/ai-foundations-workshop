# Foundations in AI Engineering

A comprehensive 1 hour 45 minute presentation covering the fundamentals of AI-powered software development.

**Presented by Stillriver**

## Overview

This presentation introduces developers to AI engineering concepts, tools, and practices. It's designed for teams beginning their AI adoption journey.

## Duration

**Total:** 1 hour 45 minutes (105 minutes)

| Section | Duration | Topics |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Introduction | 10 min | Welcome, agenda, why AI now |
| What is AI Engineering | 15 min | Definition, roles, skills |
| AI Tools Landscape | 15 min | Tool categories, key players comparison |
| Working with LLMs | 15 min | Context windows, tokens, prompting basics |
| Prompt Engineering | 20 min | Techniques, patterns, examples |
| Agent Memory | 15 min | Configuration files, best practices |
| Practical Applications | 5 min | Use cases overview (examples woven throughout) |
| Getting Started & Q&A | 10 min | Next steps, resources, discussion |

**Timing Notes:**
- Q&A expanded to 10 minutes to allow for engaged discussion
- "Practical Applications" reduced to 5 minutes as examples are demonstrated throughout other sections
- "AI Tools Landscape" focuses on tool categories rather than deep-dives into 4+ products
- "Working with LLMs" calibrated for mixed-technical audience (conceptual over implementation details)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Export to PDF
npm run export
```

## Customization

### Updating Facilitator Info

### Timing Adjustments

The presentation is designed with natural discussion points. Adjust depth of coverage based on audience engagement.

## Presentation Tips

1. **Pace yourself** - Allow time for questions during each section
2. **Demo live** - Show real AI tool usage when possible
3. **Encourage participation** - Ask attendees about their experiences
4. **Be honest about limitations** - Discuss what AI can't do well
