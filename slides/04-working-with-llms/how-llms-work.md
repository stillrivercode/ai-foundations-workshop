# Context Windows

<div class="text-xl opacity-80 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mt-6">
The AI's working memory
</div>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-10 max-w-3xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg">

### What fits in the window?

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Your instructions   │
│ + Code files        │
│ + Conversation      │
│ + AI response       │
└─────────────────────┘
```

<div class="text-sm mt-4 opacity-75">
Everything the AI can "see" at once
</div>

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Keep it focused

- More context ≠ better results
- Relevant context = better results
- Agent memory files help
- Let the AI pull what it needs

</div>

</div>

<div class="mt-8 p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center">
Think of it like a desk: too cluttered and you can't find anything
</div>

Context management is crucial. More isn't always better - relevance matters more than volume.
