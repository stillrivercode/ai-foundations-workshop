# Hands-On: Create a Slash Command

<div class="text-xl opacity-80 mt-4 mb-6">
Let the AI create your slash command
</div>

<div class="bg-blue-500/10 p-6 rounded-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto">

### Exercise

1. **Think of a task you do repeatedly**
   - Code review, testing, documentation, debugging

2. **Ask the AI to create a slash command for it**

```
Create a slash command that reviews code for
security vulnerabilities and performance issues.
```

3. **Test your new command**
   ```bash
   /review src/api.ts
   ```

</div>

<div class="mt-6 p-4 bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg text-center">
<strong>5 minutes</strong> - Create your first custom slash command
</div>

<!--
Walk around and help. The AI will create the command file for them. Have participants share what commands they created.
